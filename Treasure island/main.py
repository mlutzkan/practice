  It is a bright, sunny day. You wake up on a deserted island and try to remember how you got there, but it is all a blur. The remains of a wrecked boat near the shore start to dig out some memories. That's right! The treasure! You went with a small group of adventurers to see if the legends were true. But it seems you are the only one left after the horrible storm. Now, will you perish on this creepy island, or will you find a way to get back home, richer than you could have ever imagined, is up to you.
      Let's find out!   



You follow a narrow path that comes to a crossroad. Everything else is filled with high and dense plants that you do not recognize. It seems that you only have two options - left or right.

-Welcome to the Island of the Dead. Many people come here to search for the treasure. I don't know if it exists, but I know that no one has lived to find out. Anyway, here we are. I'm going back to my hut down the river. You seem like a nice fella, I hope you don't die too soon. Good luck!
You get out of the boat and thank him again. "Oh, and choose wisely!", the stranger says as he start rowing away.
You keep going further into the island until you see three towers made of pure gold. Surely, the treasure must be in one of them! They are all identical, except for the different colours of their doors - blue, green and red.''')

No, your eyes are fine, it is true! Gold, jewels and gems - more than you could have ever imagined!
